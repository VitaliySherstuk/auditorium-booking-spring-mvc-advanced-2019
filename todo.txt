Task description:

1. Based on the codebase of previous hometasks, create a web application,
configure Spring MVC application context and dispatcher servlet.

DONE
2. For all Booking operations implement Spring MVC annotation-based controllers.

DONE
3. For operations that return one or several entites as a result
(e.g. getUserByEmail, getUsersByName, getBookedTickets) implement simple
 views rendered via Freemarker template engine. Use FreeMarkerViewResolver
  for view resolving procedure.

DONE (beans.controllers.BookingPDFController)
4. For operations, that return list of booked tickets (by event, or by
user) implement alternative controllers, that will return result as PDF
document. Map this controller to a specific value of Accept request header
  - Accept=application/pdf

DONE (beans.controllers.BatchEventUploadController, beans.controllers.BatchUserUploadController)
5. Implement batch loading of users and events into system. In order to
do this, create controller which accepts multipart file upload, parses
it and calls all Booking functionality methods to add events and users
into the system. The format of the file (JSON, XML, ...) is up to you
as long as you can implement the correct parsing procedure.

DONE (see controllers.advice.GenericExceptionHandler)

exceptions to simple Freemarker view, that just prints exception message.
